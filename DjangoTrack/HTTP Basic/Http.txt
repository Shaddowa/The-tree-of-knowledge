Telnet is designed to comunicate with other units on the web, but aren't limited to only using HTTP

download Telnet on terminal, check external sources to figure out how 

#to communicate with a server on the internet type these commands in terminal:

        1. telnet httpbin.org 80 

#this is the default port(80) by specifing adress and port, as long as there is content on that server, you should be able to comunicate with it.

        2. GET / HTTP/ 1.1 //Extensible markup language(GET /xml HTTP) 

#A Get request that specifies what we want to fetch, in this case the HTTP request. We can also fetch the XML request. 1.1 is the version

        3. Host: httpbin.org #Hit enter twice after this "sat", so that your request don't time out.
